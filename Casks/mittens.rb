  caveats <<~EOS
    Mittens needs the macOS Accessibility permission to block system shortcuts while locked.
    Open it from Applications and allow it once in System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility.
    The way out of a locked session: hold control + option and press Q, or hold both for three seconds.
